# Ngram Type


## About

I'm recently practicing **Touch Typing** and [**Colemak DH**](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) keyboard layout to improve my typing speed/accuracy. Ngram refers to sequence/grouping of characters, and they're usually ranked to describe the common ones. Historially, ngrams are used in Crytography to decrypt messages. Nowadays, they have many applications, for classifying spam messages, as auto-completion or spell-checking tool, etc. Technically, ngrams are words also, and vice versa.

In Josh Kaufman's [**The First 20 Hours**](https://first20hours.com/) book (one of his personal challenges is to learn Colemak in 20 hours in which he succeeded), he used ngrams mostly as well as practice dataset:

> Human languages, including English, follow a power law curve called Zipfâ€™s law: a very small set of words makes up the vast majority of actual usage. Based on an analysis of The Brown Corpus (1964), a 1 million-word collection of 500 modern English documents, only 135 words account for 50 percent of all English usage.21 The word "the" itself accounts for 7.5 percent, while "of" accounts for 3.5 percent.

Hence, ngrams are practical and very useful training data. The better you're able to type these sequences of characters, the faster you'll be able to type in general. However, there's no free online typing website that integrates ngrams. And the typing tests on various websites are usually based on common English words. This project aims to provide a training ground for boosting typing speed/accuracy by focusing your performance in small and controlled phrases/chunks. Perfect training after all required perfect training on small set of data.

This **Ngram Type** project name was inspired by [**Amphetype**](https://github.com/webiest/amphetype) and [**MonkeyType**](https://monkeytype.com/). I've ported some of the ideas in the Amphetype also into this project.


## Features
* Data source could be chosen, based on the most common ngrams/words. Source settings' are independent with each other: lesson generator and minimum performance settings are set for each data source.
* Lessons could be customized and generated on-the-fly by varying the `Combination` and `Repetition` settings; you'll immediately see the effect on the generated lesson. Old lessons on the same data source selected will be overridden once you updata these settings.
* The minimum WMP/Accuracy required could be adjusted depending on your skill level.
* Has sound effects: correct key, wrong key, or failed the minimum WMP/Accuracy set.
* Has color indicator if you typed a wrong key.
* Timer will show once you start typing, for added tracking.
* Settings are saved in your browser, and will be auto-loaded when you revisit the site.
